# EA Matrix Android APK Build Instructions

## Complete Android Project Ready

I've created a complete Android project structure in `EA-Matrix-Android/` that you can use to build your APK file.

1. **Download Android Studio**: Get it from https://developer.android.com/studio

3. **Wait for Sync**: Let Gradle sync complete (this may take a few minutes)
4. **Update URL**: In `MainActivity.java`, replace `"https://your-deployed-ea-matrix-url.replit.app"` with your actual deployed URL
5. **Build APK**: Go to Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
6. **Get APK**: Find your APK at `EA-Matrix-Android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## Method 2: Using Command Line

```bash
cd EA-Matrix-Android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Method 3: Online Build Services
